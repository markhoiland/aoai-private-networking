GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a sample README file for the deployment of the ARM template with a "Deploy to Azure" button:

# Azure OpenAI ARM Template with Private Endpoint and Private DNS Zone

This ARM template deploys an Azure OpenAI resource with a private endpoint and private DNS zone. The private endpoint allows you to securely access the OpenAI resource over a private connection, while the private DNS zone ensures that the OpenAI resource is only accessible through the private endpoint.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this ARM template, you must have the following:

- An Azure subscription
- A resource group in which to deploy the resources
- A virtual network with a subnet in which to deploy the private endpoint
- A DNS zone in which to create the private DNS records

## Deploy to Azure

You can deploy this ARM template to your Azure subscription with the following button:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmarkhoiland%2Faoai-private-networking%2Fv1-updates%2Faoai-private.json)

Clicking on the "Deploy to Azure" button will take you to the Azure Portal, where you can fill in the required parameters and deploy the ARM template.

## Deployment Steps

To deploy this ARM template manually, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the ARM template repository.
2. Open the `aoai-private.parameters.json` file and update the parameter values as needed.
3. Deploy the ARM template using the Azure CLI or Azure Portal.

### Deploying with Azure CLI

To deploy the ARM template using the Azure CLI, run the following command:

```
az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file aoai-private.json --parameters aoai-private.parameters.json
```

### Deploying with Azure Portal

To deploy the ARM template using the Azure Portal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and sign in.
2. Click on the "Create a resource" button.
3. Search for "Template deployment" and select it.
4. Click on the "Create" button.
5. Upload the `aoai-private.json` file.
6. Fill in the required parameters.
7. Click on the "Review + create" button.
8. Review the deployment settings and click on the "Create" button.

## Output

After the deployment is complete, the ARM template will output the private endpoint connection string for the OpenAI resource. You can use this connection string to securely access the OpenAI resource over the private endpoint.

## Conclusion

This ARM template provides a secure way to access an Azure OpenAI resource over a private connection. By using a private endpoint and private DNS zone, you can ensure that your OpenAI resource is only accessible through a secure and private connection.
